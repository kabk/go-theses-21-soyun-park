    <div class="justify-center m-auto p-10 ">You don’t see yourself, but you’re shown to other people. You walk, you talk, you move your arms to fit the rhythm of your verbal storytelling. Sometimes people just walk past by without noticing you there, and sometimes people stop and talk with you. Your voice is heard, but people don’t know who you are. You’ve never met these people physically, I mean, in the world where gravity heavily influences your movement. But you feel more connected with them than with people who spend most of their time just 3 meters away from you with a thin wall in between.<br><br>
            Morpheus shows two pills in his hands. Blue or red? You’re deeply confused but you are pushed to make a decision. There are only two choices though, it’s either a dream or a painful reality. You think, but, what if, my dream became my reality and my reality became my dream? Morpheus asks you back: What do you mean?<br><br>
            In front of him in the rainy darkness, before you get into this telephone booth to make a harsh choice, you bring out your stories of your ‘dream’ which you choose not to entirely wake up from. Your reality goes on because of your dream, and your dream goes on because of your reality. Your reality is not painful anymore because your dream exists even after waking up. Then why should I even choose the pill from these two, Morpheus?<br><br>
            By you saying that, the pills became blurry. Then you didn’t know what pill is which colour anymore. They are blurred in a cloudy form, both of them. Morpheus occasionally nods his head and listens to you carefully. He looks confused, but curious.</div>

While physically meeting people is prohibited to some extent in many places, the community-based virtual games such as VRchat and Second Life flourished and provided spaces where immersive online interactions happen. The users of both games created relationships with the other users with whom they can share their emotions and memories. Experiencing the two games myself, I investigated the elements in the game contributing to enhance user engagement and narrow the gap between the two realities. Following the investigation, I discuss how virtual spaces can be designed borrowing the architecture and sonic experience from reality to trigger certain interactions and actions. Depending on the system and the architecture in the game, the games do not remain only on screens, it continuously affects the reality and is, again, affected by it. Therefore, I empathise the importance of having this awareness as a creator.
