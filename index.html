You walk, you talk, you move your arms to fit the rhythm of your verbal storytelling. Sometimes people just walk past by without noticing you there, and sometimes people stop and talk with you. Your voice is heard, but people don’t know who you are. You’ve never met these people physically, I mean, in the world where gravity heavily influences your movement. But you feel more connected with them than with people who spend most of their time just 3 meters away from you with a thin wall in between.<br><br>
            Morpheus shows two pills in his hands. Blue or red? You’re deeply confused but you are pushed to make a decision. There are only two choices though, it’s either a dream or a painful reality. You think, but, what if, my dream became my reality and my reality became my dream? Morpheus asks you back: What do you mean?<br><br>
            In front of him in the rainy darkness, before you get into this telephone booth to make a harsh choice, you bring out your stories of your ‘dream’ which you choose not to entirely wake up from. Your reality goes on because of your dream, and your dream goes on because of your reality. Your reality is not painful anymore because your dream exists even after waking up. Then why should I even choose the pill from these two, Morpheus?<br><br>
            By you saying that, the pills became blurry. Then you didn’t know what pill is which colour anymore. They are blurred in a cloudy form, both of them. Morpheus occasionally nods his head and listens to you carefully. He looks confused, but curious.</div>

        <p class="py-4">In the age of global pandemic, our identity and presence in the virtual world became more important than any other times in human history. While physically meeting people is prohibited to some extent in many places, the community-based virtual games such as VRchat and Second Life flourished and provided spaces where immersive online interactions happen. The users of both games created relationships with the other users with whom they can share their emotions and memories. Experiencing the two games myself, I investigated the elements in the game contributing to enhance user engagement and narrow the gap between the two realities. Following the investigation, I discuss how virtual spaces can be designed borrowing the architecture and sonic experience from reality to trigger certain interactions and actions. Depending on the system and the architecture in the game, the games do not remain only on screens, it continuously affects the reality and is, again, affected by it. Therefore, I empathise the importance of having this awareness as a creator.</p>

            In April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, the famous online virtual reality game ‘VRchat’ brought a lot of its users online. VRchat is a free, Windows operating system based community game, which has a large amount of user-made worlds anyone can explore. It enables users to play with a VR headset for motion tracking and to communicate with other users in an avatar. In this chapter, I play VRchat going in and out to different rooms and communicate with other users to see how the experience is different, or similar to real life. <br><br>
            I’ve been watching many gameplay videos from just wandering around in different places to have very personal conversations with complete strangers. User ID iListen on Youtube uploads videos of VRchat gameplay regularly. Majority of his videos are about very personal stories he hears from people who he meets in the game. Alongside 144k followers, millions of viewers listen to these intimate stories that he shares. Not only iListen, but also quite lots of YouTubers share this sort of videos and it often attracts a large amount of viewers.
            What fascinated me the most here was how individuals can be extremely open to people who they have never met in real life and bring up their childhood scars, family issues, and mental struggles in this VRchat world. I wondered how people can feel safe as much as to be able to share their vulnerable stories in the virtual space. How did the people decide to extensively expand their social environment to the VR space? What makes the VR communities flourish? With the excitement, curiosity, and a VR goggle, I decided to jump into the game.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

                    This chapter shows how the space is introduced to users just starting the game, and how it is similar to our own room, where we have the most privacy. The game starts with entering your room which is exactly the same room in appearance as the other people’s room. But it is the only private place in this world that exists, because the user exists. Wearing the virtual reality goggles, there are some options in sight. There are game learning areas, multiple portals that you can go through to the different worlds, a chill area to rest, and pens to write or to draw something in your environment. The world here is seen in your eyes with a very common perspective in video games, a first-person point of view. Your space changes by how you move, it illuminates the imagery of yourself from the world and leaves the imagination about the existence of yourself up to you.<br><br>
                    There are several objects and furniture in the room, pillows that you can hold and throw, a couch to sit down on, and a big mirror to look at yourself. At this place you can practice the body movements and interactions like walking, sitting, jumping, crawling, throwing, talking through your microphone... which you would make in the outside of the room in the larger world. Because here the visualisation of yourself is missing, the only way to identify your existence is looking at the ‘mirror’, which is a plane in the 3d place calculating the mirrored image of you. <br><br>
                    Here, how you are is your choice. You can be any’thing’ - a truck, a dog, an anime-character, darthvader, or a person you wanted to be. Once you’ve chosen your avatar you can step into the shining portal, which leads you to a completely different space
